### Overskride Version 0.4.4
- better "device is connected" handling
- (maybe) fixed issue where an unrelated device getting deleted would deselect device
- better error message when transfers fail
- sending file when device isn't connected no longer crashes a thread
- added "sending" and "receiving" toasts along with respective downloads menu tweaks
- fixed formatting for transferred amount in downloads menu
- added toasts for when a transfer succeeds/fails/starts
- started on foundation for "save file to location" feature
- cancelling outbound transfer *still* doesn't work
- switching adapters now completely resets devices list (doubtful change)
